# Classificaton_Models

Classification is a form of machine learning in which you train a model to predict which category an item belongs to. For example, a health clinic might use diagnostic data such as a patient's height, weight, blood pressure, blood-glucose level to predict whether or not the patient is diabetic.

Categorical data has distinct 'classes', rather than numeric values. Some kinds of data can be either numeric or categorical: the time to run a race could be a time in seconds, or we could split times into classes of ‘fast’, ‘medium’ and ‘slow’ - categorical. While other kinds of data can only be categorical, such as a type of shape - ‘circle’, ‘triangle’, or ‘square’.

Supervised machine learning techniques involve training a model to operate on a set of features and predict a label using a dataset that includes some already-known label values. You can think of this function like this, in which y represents the label we want to predict and X represents the vector of features the model uses to predict it.

   Y = f([x1,x2,x3....xn])
   
Classification is a form of supervised machine learning in which you train a model to use the features (the x values in our function) to predict a label (y) that calculates the probability of the observed case belonging to each of a number of possible classes, and predicting an appropriate label. The simplest form of classification is binary classification, in which the label is 0 or 1, representing one of two classes; for example, "True" or "False"; "Internal" or "External"; "Profitable" or "Non-Profitable"; and so on.
